# Weather Prediction

Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. People have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere, land, and ocean and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change at a given place.

This repository contains a set of linear models used for weather forecasting on a dataset of US weather between 2006 and 2016. These models are implemented in Python and leverage various statistical techniques to predict weather patterns based on historical data.

## Files Overview

- **anova.py**: This file contains functions for conducting analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the significance of different variables in the weather prediction models.

- **correlations.py**: Here, you'll find code for calculating correlations between weather variables and exploring their relationships.

- **data_utils.py**: Utility functions for loading, preprocessing, and handling data are provided in this module.

- **goodness_of_fit_residual_analysis.py**: This file includes functions for evaluating the goodness of fit of the linear models and analyzing residuals.

- **linear_model.py**: The core of the repository, this file houses the implementation of various linear models used for weather prediction.

- **logger.py**: A logging module for capturing and recording important information and events during the execution of the code.

- **main.py**: The main entry point of the application, where weather prediction tasks are orchestrated and executed.

- **post_hoc_analysis.py**: Contains functions for conducting post-hoc analysis to further investigate relationships between variables.

- **task_1.py** and **task_2.py**: These files contain specific tasks or experiments related to weather prediction, each encapsulated within a separate module.

- **utils.py**: Miscellaneous utility functions used across different modules of the repository.
